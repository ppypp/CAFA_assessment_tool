# Assessment of Protein Function Prediction

## Introduction
Critical Assessment of Function Annotation (CAFA), is a community-wide challenge designed to provide a large-scale assessment of computational methods dedicated to predicting protein function.

More information can be found at http://biofunctionprediction.org/cafa/ as well as the CAFA2 paper (Jiang et al, 2016)

This toolset provides an assessment for CAFA submissions. 

For bug reports, comments or questions, please email nzhou[AT]iastate.edu.

## Dependencies
 - Python 3
 - Python packages can be downloaded from their sites or installed from repositories:
    1. [Biopython](http://biopython.org)
    2. [yaml](http://www.yaml.org/download.html)
    3. [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) 
    4. [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
    
`$ sudo apt install python-biopython python-yaml python-matplotlib python-seaborn`

## Main Functions
 We provide two main functions to assist in the evaluation of GO-term prediction within the scope of CAFA, the main assessment function and the plot function.
 - `assessment.py` 
    - Only input needed is the configuration file `config.yaml`, where the following parameters are specified in the first section `assessment`.
    - First parameter  `prediction_path` : prediction file formatted according to [CAFA3 formats](https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn5840147/wiki/402192)
    - Second parameter  `obo_path`       : path of the gene ontology obo file. The latest version can be downloaded [here](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/go.obo). Note that the obo file used here should not be older than the one used in the prediction.	
    - Third parameter `ic_path`          : path of the calculated infromation content map. This must be made prior to running `assessment.py`. This is achieved by running `IC.py` in the ICTool directory, instructions below in auxillary functions.
    - Fourth parameter `benchmark_path`  : directory of the benchmark folder. Specific formats are required for the benchmark folder, including two sub-directories: groundtruth and lists. Please refer to auxiliary function `benchmark_folder.py` for the creation of this folder, as well as the genral creation of benchmarks. An example benchmark folder is given in this repository `./assessment/benchmark`
    - Fifth parameter  `results_path`    : Folder where results are saved. A `rawdata` folder will be created within the results folder.
    - Seventh parameter `gaf_path`       : Location of the IC File 
    - Eigth parameter `gaf_path`         : Location of the GAF File (with respect to the ICTool directory if relative)
    - Note that only the first section `assessment` of the configuration file is used here, the rest of the configuration file can be ignored for this function	
 


## Auxiliary Functions 
 CAFA3 released its [protein targets](https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn6172284) in September 2016. Each protein target has a unique CAFA3 ID. To run the above assessment function, each protein should be represented by its CAFA3 ID. However, the benchmark proteins generated by the [benchmark creation tool](https://github.com/nguyenngochuy91/CAFA_benchmark) are identified by UniProt Accession IDs. 
Therefore, we here provide functions to convert between UniProt IDs and CAFA3 IDs. We also provide a function that converts benchmark files generated by the [benchmark creation tool](https://github.com/nguyenngochuy91/CAFA_benchmark) to a benchmark folder that can feed into this program.
 - `benchmark_folder.py`
	- Refer to `python benchmark_folder.py -h` for syntax of using this function by itself.
	- If using our [benchmark creation tool](https://github.com/nguyenngochuy91/CAFA_benchmark), then the `benchmark_pipeline.sh` file is a good example of how to generate a benchmark folder for `assessment.py` from the raw benchmarks.
	- Input your own folder names and different gaf file names in the blanks left in `benchmark_pipeline.sh`.
 	
 - `./ID_conversion/ID_conversion.py` 
	- Two functions are written in this python script, one converts UniProt Accessions to CAFA3 IDs, the other function converts the other way around.
	- First function `uniprotac_to_cafaid(taxon, uniprotacs)`.
	- Second function `cafaid_to_uniprot(taxon, cafaids)`.
	- Refer to comments in the script `./ID_conversion/ID_conversion.py` and third example below for usage.
 
- `./ICTool/IC-GAF.py` 
	- Calculates the Information content of a given OBO
	- How to use: From the ICTool directory `IC.py ../config.yaml`.
	-  It uses the assessement config file, so once you have that setup, this will run on the same file set.

 - `./ICTool/IC-LIST.py` 
	- Calculates the Information content of a given a list of Proteins, Terms and Ontologies.
	- How to use: From the ICTool directory `IC.py ../config.yaml`.
	-  It uses the assessement config file, so once you have that setup, this will run on the same file set.

- `./ICTool/IC-MATRIX.py` 
	- Calculates the Information content of a given a list of Proteins, Terms and Ontologies.
	- How to use: From the ICTool directory `IC.py ../config.yaml`.
	-  It uses the assessement config file, so once you have that setup, this will run on the same file set.

## Examples	
 - `./assessment.py config.yaml`
 - `./ID_conversion/ID_conversion.py ./ID_conversion/example_uniprot_accession_8355.txt 8355 ./ID_conversion/example_output.txt`
 - `./benchmark_pipeline.sh`
